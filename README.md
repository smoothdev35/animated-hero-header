This is a creative experiment around the idea of a "hero" header. Since full-screen large media (picture/video) is a common trend, 
I wanted to use my favorite combination, svg + gsap, to add some texture and motion to said "hero" picture. 

The chosen picture is one of a beautiful tree in the forest, with its branches organized in a way that it looks like the tree is "walking". 
With an evident theme to work with, I started with a red-orange color since it felt like a nice combination between the natural theme-friendly
red/brown and a brighter orange color, known to evoke feelings of dynamism and enthusiasm, a perfect pair for a moving design!

The steps for animation come in this order:




The animation uses the core gsap library as well as three paid plugins, namely DrawSVGPlugin, MotionPathPlugin and SplitText, which are free to use on the codepen website, but I can't include the plugin in the js folder here since all greensock files are subject to their own license. I purchased a paid plan, so the live demo is in agreement with the license terms.
